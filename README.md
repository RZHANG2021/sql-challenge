Background
There are data supposedly contains the employees’ information from 1980s and 1991. All the data are stored in six csv files.

The goals of the challenge are:

Through data engineering and data analysis:                                                                                                                                          
design tables to hold data in the CSV files, 

import the CSV files into a SQL database

after completing the database, display the below listed information 

•	List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

•	List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

•	List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

•	List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

•	List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

•	List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

•	List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

•	In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.


After examining the data, import the SQL database into Pandas

•	Create a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.

•	Create a bar chart of average salary by title.

utilizing the analysis, to validate if the data set is legit or fake

Conclusion:

The data is fake, as from the histogram chart, the chart shows the salary range and the salary spread among all the employees. Taking the information from the histogram chart, and compare to the bar chart, where the average salaries for all job titles are quite similar, there is not much difference comparing senior staff salaries to the junior level salaries.
